# FluxQubit
MATLAB codes for superconducting circuit quantum elecrodynamics simulations.

This repository includes the MATLAB codes that I developed during my PhD project at UCL (UK) for analysing properties of superconducitng cirucits for Quantum
Annealing applications.
The codes define two class objects, FluxQubit, representing a individual connected superconducting circuit, and QubitsInteract, which can be used for coupling
different FluxQubit objects with physical interactions (either capacitive or inductive).

Two example files are also included.

The numerical approach is based on the work by A. J. Kerman, “Efficient numerical simulation of complex Josephson quantum circuits”. In: arXiv preprint
arXiv:2010.14929 (2020).
